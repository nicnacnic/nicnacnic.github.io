            Set in 1600's Spain, <i>Bernarda Alba</i> follows the captivating journey of recent widow Bernarda and her quest to stop her daughters from going out and exploring the world.

        This show was all about working within strict limitations. Produced as one of two shows in rep, the challenge was getting the design through to the stage <b>on a shared plot</b> with another designer. The space also posed significant challenges, with a very outdated inventory, small footprint, as well as no fog or haze allowed. Despite the collaborative nature of two shows done in rep, I ended up doing all the plot work myself, allowing for some more flexibility for my show.
        <p>
            The design focused on shadows, isolation, and the idea that "less is more". Bright colors were reserved for large musical numbers and emotional moments, with the rest of the show having a dark, dingy atmosphere. The white set was annoying to work with, as light would bounce from the walls all over the space. The chandelier and sconces on the back wall played a key role; lighting up the space in a spooky manor without being too bright and ruining the effect.

            Barely any cueing and tech time meant I was on my toes and working fast the whole time, despite this I got lots of praise from professors, students and audience members for the color choices and beautiful scene transitions found in the cues. The show was sold out for every performance of the 4 night run! This production really tested my efficiently and quick-decision making, as things needed to be decided quickly on-the-spot to be able to get the show open on time.
