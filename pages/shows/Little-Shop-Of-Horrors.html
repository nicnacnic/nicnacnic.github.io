        <p>This show was all about the Audrey II puppets, from simple plant to actor devouring monster. We worked closely with a real puppeteer to design and build the four iterations. The cast and crew loved it, but it was a challenge to design it. As you can see, it does a good job at digesting the actors thanks to the effort of our design team to which I contributed. I also designed the vines that you can see in the second half of the show, and their mechanism to drop from the ceiling at the end. Lighting included a couple effects, including rain combined with thunder sounds to dramatize several key scenes.
