        <p>Composed by famed French composer Francis Poulenc, <i>Dialogues of the Carmelites</i> tells the story of a young noblewoman who becomes a nun, against the wishes of her father and brother, at the height of the terror following the French Revolution. Her decision sets events in motion that lead to an outcome that is both tragic and triumphant.

            Since this production took place in a recital hall instead of traditional theatre, there were definitely some challenges and arbitrary limitations that were placed on us. For one, we were not allowed to change the mode of many of the fixtures, which frustrated both myself and Steve, the designer. Some other notable limitations was the lack of any venue documentation, all of which I had to create myself, and limited time and resources, especially during strike.
        </p>

            Even with all these limitations, everything went very smoothly over the course of the production. I'm proud that my first professional production outside the safety net of the Penn State School of Theatre went very well and I'm looking froward to working on bigger and more complex shows in the future!
