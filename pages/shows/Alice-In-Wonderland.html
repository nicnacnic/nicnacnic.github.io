            A combination of the classic tale and Through The Looking Glass, <i>Alice In Wonderland</i> follows Alice and her journey of self-discovery through the rabbit hole.
        </p>
            While previous designs were working within strict limitations, this was my time to let my creativity shine. I spent a lot of time thinking about how I wanted to represent this new world that we were building, and how to shed light on each character's unique characteristics. I thoroughly enjoyed finding each character's light to really sell this world that the design team had in mind.
        <p>
            The design focused on shadows, isolation, and the idea that "less is more". Bright colors were reserved for big scenes and emotional moments, with the rest of the show having a dark, gloomy atmosphere. The set was wonderful to work with, the vast open space gave me a big canvas to work and shape with light, or darkness. There are some absolutely beautiful moments-but also some very weird and spooky moments in this world.

            The most difficult part of this production was interplaying with projections and the director. Unlike my previous shows, me and the director had two vastly different ideas on how to represent this world, and I spent my time thinking through my design choices to match the director's vision, while also mixing some of my ideas and creativity. The result was a beautiful new environment that perfectly represented Alice and the eccentric cast of characters.
