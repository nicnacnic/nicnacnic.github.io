        <p>A last-minute job posting led me to work on <i>Cinderella</i>, a children's show produced by <a
                href="https://www.stageleftct.org">Stage Left Children's Theater</a>. As I was brought on very late in
            the process, there wan't much wiggle room with some choices the previous
            designer made. When I got there, the plot was already hung, and there was no opputunity to change things
            such as templates and barrel sizes. But I wasn't deterred, I've worked with limited spaces before and made
            the show look amazing, despite the limitations.
        </p>
        <p>
            My primary goal during this production was to provide enough front light so that parents could see their
            children perform. But that doesn't mean that I didn't try and go all out, there were some amazing moments
            such as the royal ball, transformation, and marriage scenes. because of the way the cyc lights and the set
            interacted, I was really able to take full advantage of what was on offer and really add some depth to the
            locations that we were transported to.
        </p>
        <p>
            I'm especially proud with how the transformation scene looked after everything was set and done. The
            previous designer left me some rotating glass gobos, and I used those to create this amazing magical effect.
            That was in addition to star projections and extensive use of effects to create flashing lights and to sell
            the magic of the moment. I'm really happy with how everything turned out despite the limitations and time
            constraints, and I'm looking froward to working on their future productions!
