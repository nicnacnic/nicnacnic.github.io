        <p>Arguably, The Secret In The Wings was my favorite show to work on at my time at Bronxville High School. I was
            the sole lighting designer on the show, but was also able to learn and take full advantage of our 4 new High
            End System Solaframe 1000's to create many effects such as the green pattern displayed on the stage. This
            was a request by the director to use lighting to establish a common theme for the play. I found these new
            lights very powerful to bring a new creative level to lighting and showcase the mood on stage. Other duties
            included communicating with the director and crew, and building various set pieces such as the large
            staircase found upstage right. This was also a fun show with all the jokes that kept us entertained.
