        <p>Set in the middle of Leo Tolstoyâ€™s "War & Peace", this musical explores the moral ambiguities of love and satisfaction, as we await the fate of The Great Comet passing overhead.

            The scale of this show was massive for us, pushing every department to its limits. As the Assistant Lighting Designer, I was responsible for making sure all the lighting systems were properly prepared so the lighting designer, Mason LoPiccolo, could execute their vision. Early on, the entire team was plagued with issues because of the scope of this show; we made bad decisions that put us far behind where we needed to be. As we started to focus lights, there were still entire systems that were not functional, combined with a lack of crew due to another show happening at the same time. Despite these problems, focus went well as it could have, with me sitting at the table directing the crew and coming up with strategies to speed things up. I was always prepared with a backup plan in case something didn't work as expected and I kept constant communication with the lighting designer, giving updates and pointers to keep us moving.        </p>
        <p>
            In the end, the show opened on time to great fanfare, although with some of the more fancy effects cut due to time constraints. This was a wonderful learning opportunity for me despite the issues, it sharpened my skills and helped me improve my thinking and quick decision making under pressure.        </p>
