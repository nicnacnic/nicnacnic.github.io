        <p>For my THEA 270 class, we were tasked to design a light show around a pre-selected piece of music. The music
            that was selected for me was <i>Mars, Bringer of War</i>, composed by Gustav Holst.
        </p>
        <p>
            After throwing around a bunch of ideas in my head, I eventually settled on a general theme of <b>Soils of
                War</b>. The story that I came up with involved a young army man falling in love with a female
            colleague, before everything goes wrong when the enemy finds the squadron.
        </p>
        <p>
            During most of the track, I was going for a scary, spooky, unsettling feeling, hence the combined use of red
            and very dim lighting. There were some times where that was not the case, for example when the music was
            more vivid, I used a more "grand" look, with lighting that was brighter and had a more varied color palette.
        </p>
        <p>
            On the technical side, the entire show was programmed using timecode. Using a software program called
            Reaper, my computer would generate a timecode signal synced with the music. My computer was plugged into the
            console via MIDI, and the console would trigger cues off a pre-programmed event list based on the time that
            it was receiving.
        </p>
        <p>
            Overall, I'm very happy with the end result! This project had a total of 190 cues, 4 effects, all programmed
            over the course of 10 hours. My professor, William Kenyon, enjoyed it as well, praising the use of color and
            intensity to complement the music. Through this project, I've gained a new perspective on the differences of
            programming for music instead of theatre.
