        <p>This was a rep show that was on it's 4th and final stop for the summer. For me, this was my first large-scale
            outdoor show, and I used skills I previously picked up on smaller shows to some success. I had an assistent
            and a regular electrician working under me with various skill levels. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Being in a new space proved challenging, but with help from my assistant Louis (who helped catch many of my
            errors), we were able to get everything hung, curcuited and tested in record time. I also had to take care
            of some administrative duties, such as compliling daily schedules and dealing with outside companies to get
            materials needed for certain tasks. Of course, mistakes were made, and this show really pushed me hard and
            help me develop a lot of organizational and manigorial skills that I now use every day in my work.
        </p>
        <p>
            While there were a couple of issues during tech, as there always is, they all got ironed out by the preview
            and the show opened on time to much fanfare. I cannot thank enough the people who helped and supported me
            throughoug this
            challenging process, including Josh, Mae and especially Tammy. This show would not have been possible
            without their
            wisdom and support.
