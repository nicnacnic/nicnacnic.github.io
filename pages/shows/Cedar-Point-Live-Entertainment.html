        <p>Working under the Master Electrician at Cedar Point's main venue, Celebration Stage, my duties were varied throughout the summer and depended on what show(s) were happening that day. In general, I was in change of maintaining the lighting system at the stage under the direction of the ME and upper level management. This included tasks such as de-spidering the back scaffolding, cleaning bird poop off lighting fixtures, waterproofing and maintaining the distribution boxes, and ensuring that the rig was safe to everyone around it.
        </p>
        <p>
            For the day shows, <i>Pump Up Pep Rally</i> and <i>Peanuts Block Party</i>, my job was to assist the Assistant Stage Manager with their duties, making sure everything was clean and safe backstage. This also included various stage crew tasks, as filling waters, fetching towels, and sweeping the stage when necessary.
        </p>
        <p>
            For the night show, <i>Celebrate Cedar Point Spectacular</i>, I was also in charge of maintaining the various strips of LED tape on the stairs, and replacing them as necessary. This often required me to crawl under the stage to access the DMX decoders to replace broken wiring.
        </p>
        <p>
            Finally, on days where the ME was not present, I would fill into their role. On top of my normal duties, I would sit in the booth and run the shows as well as communicate with upper level management about the status of the stage.
