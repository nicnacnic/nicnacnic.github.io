        <p>This was a small, student-run show set up by the Penn State School of Theatre Student Diversity Committee to
            highlight and recognize everyone's unique personalities. The main theme was Stories from Home, where
            performers would talk about and then preform something from their home country.
        </p>
        <p>
            In terms of the design, it was very basic. I was using a rep rig made up of all incandecents, and since I
            was so busy around that time, I did not have the liberty to pick and install gels. Therefore, the only thing
            I had to work with were single-color incandecents with focusses that weren't great.
        </p>
        <p>
            Even with those limitations, I played around with the shape and intensity of the lights to make each act
            unique, and to highlight a certain part of the music in each act. It came out really well and everyone
            enjoyed seeing each performer's amazing talents!</p>
