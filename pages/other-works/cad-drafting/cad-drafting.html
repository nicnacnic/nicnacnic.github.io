        <p>Here are a couple examples of some CAD draftings I made over the years. The main program I use is AutoCAD,
            and I'm familiar with both the 2D and 3D workspace, as well as plating and exporting.</p>
        <p>My process involces first drafting what I can in 2D, then extruding bodies and shapes, assembling in 3D, and
            finally adding smaller details before plating and exporting.</p>
        <p>For show-specific draftings, please find those files in their respective gallery pages.</p>
