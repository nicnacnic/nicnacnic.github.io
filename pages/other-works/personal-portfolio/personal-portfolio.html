        <p>Loving this website? That's great to hear!</p>
        <p>This portfolio wasn't made using online website builders or offline WYSIWYG tools-I handcoded it with my
            bare two hands (and a lot of help from StackOverflow!). It's a testament and visual example of my
            self-taught coding and web design skills in action! I coded it over a slow week during the spring of 2023.
        </p>
        <p>
            My original portfolio was built off Google Sites, while it was a nice tool to use for a simple site, I hit
            its limitations really quickly. My main gripe was with the visuals, there were lots of small nitpicks on
            text/image sizing and placement, the lack of a good image/document viewer, and also my website traffic data
            being scraped by Google. So instead, I decided to put my coding skills to the test and build my own to get
            around Google Sites' limitations.
        </p>
        <p>From initial publication, the website has not changed dramatically. Outside of regular content updates as I work
            on more shows and projects, I've introduced quality-of-life features to the site over the years, such as the
            sorting options in the gallery, a better mobile layout, and the ability to click and see pictures in a
            bigger size.</p>
        <p>
            Here are some more technical details for you tech-saavy folks! This site is built entirely using raw HTML,
            CSS and JavaScript-I did not use any external packages or component libraries. Because I wanted a free
            hosting solution, I settled with GitHub Pages that allows custom domains in repositories. However-GitHub
            does have some limitations that I had to work around, most notably the lack of a good page routing system.
        </p>
        <p>
            I had to come up with a hacky solution to get around the lackluster routing system. When you navigate to a
            page that isn't the home page, you first get directed to a custom 404 page that you can set up with GitHub.
            In that HTML file, there is a JavaScript function that checks your current URL to a JSON file that has every
            possible page path. If the URL is valid, it then loads the corresponding HTML, CSS and JS files, and updates
            the navigation bar to that current page path. You can see the raw code in <a
                href="https://github.com/nicnacnic/nicnacnic.github.io/blob/main/404.html">404.html</a>
        </p>
        <p>
            Content-wise, the website pages are fully modular, and it's pretty easy to add a page. All I have to do is
            copy the template page, give it a name, edit the text content, get some images uploaded, edit the config
            file to add that page to the site, and then push the updates to GitHub. It takes me about 15 minutes per new
            page I want to add, which is comparable in time to what it would take me on a website builder, the
            difference with my system being you have to have a base knowledge in HTML/CSS to work it.
        </p>
        <p>The source code is free and open-source, and I've recycled it for use on other projects and sites. Feel free
            to take a peek if you'd like to see more under the hood!</p>
